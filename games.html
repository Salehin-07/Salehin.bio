  FC Mobile, formerly known as FIFA Mobile, is EA Sports' flagship football simulation game for mobile devices. Originally launched as FIFA Mobile in 2016, it was designed to bring the excitement of FIFA Ultimate Team to smartphones, allowing players to build squads, compete in matches, and engage in various game modes. Over the years, FIFA Mobile evolved with improved graphics, new mechanics, and expanded leagues, including UEFA Champions League and domestic competitions. In 2023, EA Sports rebranded the game as FC Mobile, marking the end of its partnership with FIFA and ushering in a new era of football gaming under the EA SPORTS FC brand.
