   Hello Guys!!
</h1>
<p>
  My name is Md Abu Salehin. I am new to programming.<br> I am still learning. Stay with me and help me become a great Coder. Thanks!
</p>
<h1>
  Introduction
</h1>
<p>
  I’m a high school student from Bangladesh, studying at Bindubasini Govt. Boys' High School. I enjoy learning, creating, and sharing my knowledge with others, whether it's in school, coding, or other projects I'm passionate about.

  Skills and Achievements
</h1>
<p>
  I am good at HTML and CSS. I learned a bit of python also. As for Achievements I really don't have anything remarkable or worth mentioning. But hope that would be able to change the line someday.
</p>
<h1>
  Hobbies and Interests
</h1>
<p>
  I am an Anime lover. Some may say it's cartoon but it's just something that only 1 episode is enough to show you your "OUKAT"(value).I also love playing FC and reading books. Mostly detective style story. Coding was also a hobby of mine.
</p>
<h1>
  Personal Qualities
</h1>
<p>
  I’m persistent and thoughtful, always looking to improve myself and turn ideas into reality. I like to approach challenges methodically, whether it’s learning something new or solving a tricky problem. Creativity and self-improvement keep me motivated every day.
</p>
<h1>
  Youtube!!!
</h1>
<p>
  I own a youtube channel. It's name is GHOST_FC. It's not a coding or programming channel. It's a gaming channel. I’m focused on improving it by refining its branding and content.
